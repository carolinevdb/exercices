EXECISE 2: normalize to BCNF

1) List the attributes of the enity, identify the main key - this must be unique, identify the repeatin group of attributes and identify the key from the repeating group	
UNF	app(stafNo, dentistName, patienNo, patientName, appdate, time, surgeryNo)

2) As per the rule of first normal form, an attribute (column) of a   table cannot hold multiple values.
1NF	app(staffNo, appdate, time, patienNo, patienName)
	surgery(staffNo, appdate, sugeryNo)
	dentist(staffNo, dentistName)

3) No non-prime attribute is dependent on the proper subset of any candidate key of table.
2NF	1NF

4) Transitive functional dependency(indirectly formed by two functional dependencies) of non-prime attribute on any super key should be removed.
3NF	app(staffNo, appdate, time, patienNo)
	surgery(staffNo, appdate, sugeryNo)
	dentist(staffNo, dentistName)
	patient(patientNo, patienName)

5) Any attribute on which some other attribute is full functionally dependent = determinant, every determinant is a candidate key.  
BCNF	3NF
